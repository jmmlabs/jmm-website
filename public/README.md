# Public Assets Structure

## /hannah-timeline
Event images for the Hannah timeline, organized by event folder. Each folder contains a README with instructions.

## /audio
Audio files for the site.

## /avatars, /icons, /site-assets
Avatars, icons, logos, backgrounds, favicons, and other site-wide assets.

## /uploads, /temp
User uploads and temporary files.

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names.
- Optimize images (max width 1200px, use jpg/webp for photos).
- Keep this structure for easy maintenance.
